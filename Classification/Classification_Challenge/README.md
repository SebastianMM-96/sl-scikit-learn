# k-Nearest Neighbors

Basic idea: Predict the label of a data point by:
* Looking at the 'k' closet labeled data points
* Taking a majority vote

## scikit-learn fit and predict

* All machine learning models implemented as Python classes

* Training a model on the data = 'fitting' a model to the data:
    - ```.fit()``` method

* To predict the labels of new data:
    - ```.predict()``` method
